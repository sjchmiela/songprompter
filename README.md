## Tips & tricks

### Verses and chorus

The song text should look like this:

```
Text of chorus
And another line if you like
Notice the two hashes after separating chorus
##
Text of verse 1
With another
And another line

Text of verse 2
Notice the empty line
Between the verses
```

If you don't want a chorus just don't add it.
